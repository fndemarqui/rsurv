\title{The Log-Logistic Distribution}
\usage{
dloglogistic(x, shape, scale, log = FALSE)

ploglogistic(q, shape, scale, lower.tail = TRUE, log.p = FALSE)

qloglogistic(p, shape, scale, lower.tail = TRUE, log.p = FALSE)

rloglogistic(n, shape, scale)
}
\arguments{
\item{x, q}{vector of quantiles.}

\item{shape}{shape parameter. Must be positive.}

\item{scale}{scale parameter. Must be positive.}

\item{log, log.p}{logical; if \code{TRUE}, probabilities/densities p are returned
as log(p).}

\item{lower.tail}{logical; if \code{TRUE} (default), probabilities are
\eqn{P[X \le x]}, otherwise, \eqn{P[X > x]}.}

\item{p}{vector of probabilities.}

\item{n}{number of observations. If \code{length(n) > 1}, the length is taken to
be the number required.}
}
\value{
\code{dloglogistic} gives the density, \code{ploglogistic} gives the distribution
function, \code{qloglogistic} gives the quantile function, and \code{rloglogistic}
generates random deviates.

The length of the result is determined by \code{n} for \code{rloglogistic}, and is the
maximum of the lengths of the numerical arguments for the other functions.

\description{
Density, distribution function, quantile function and random generation
for the log-logistic distribution with shape and scale parameters.
}
\details{
The log-logistic distribution is a continuous probability distribution
for a non-negative random variable. It is the probability distribution
of a random variable whose logarithm has a logistic distribution.

The probability density function is given by:
\deqn{f(x) = \frac{(\alpha/\gamma)(x/\gamma)^{\alpha-1}}{(1+(x/\gamma)^\alpha)^2}}
for \eqn{x \geq 0}, where \eqn{\alpha} is the shape parameter and
\eqn{\gamma} is the scale parameter.

The cumulative distribution function is:
\deqn{F(x) = \frac{1}{1+(x/\gamma)^{-\alpha}}}
}
\examples{
# Density at x = 1 with shape = 2 and scale = 1
dloglogistic(1, shape = 2, scale = 1)

# CDF at x = 1
ploglogistic(1, shape = 2, scale = 1)

# Quantile for p = 0.5 (median)
qloglogistic(0.5, shape = 2, scale = 1)

# Generate 10 random values
rloglogistic(10, shape = 2, scale = 1)
